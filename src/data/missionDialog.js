  "Attention all mission specialists! There’s an asteroid approaching and— huh? …no one’s here?",
  "…You’ve got to be kidding me.",
  "…Wait. You there—yes, you! Congratulations, Commander. You’re now the entire Planetary Defense Force.",
  "Let’s see what we’re dealing with… [scanning incoming object]",
  "Ah. Here’s the situation: A big space rock’s headed straight for Earth. The asteroid’s stats are on your screen—size, speed, mass, distance… basically a list of reasons to panic.",
  "Alright, focus. Here’s our so-called ‘arsenal’ — and I use that word generously.",
  "Nuclear Deflection: we detonate a nuke next to the asteroid, not on it — just enough to shove it off course. Kinetic Impactor: we slam a spacecraft into it at ridiculous speed. No explosions, just pure, dumb momentum.",
  "Gravity Tractor: we park a ship next to it and gently tug with gravity. And Laser Ablation: we burn one side of it with a high-energy laser so it gently drifts off course.",
  "Pick your weapon. Adjust power, angle, all that fancy stuff. Try to make physics proud. You get five shots.",
  "So— ready to save humanity, Commander?"

## Features

### 1. Defend Earth Game üéÆ

**Defend Earth** is an interactive simulation game where users prevent asteroid collisions with Earth. Players engage in strategic decision-making using real physics-based planetary defense methods.

**Key Features:**
- Choose from **four real deflection methods**:
  - Nuclear device
  - Gravity tractor
  - Kinetic impactor
  - Laser ablation
- Adjust **power levels** and **deflection angles**.
- Receive **real-time success probability feedback** to optimize strategies.
- Select **2D or 3D visualization modes** to watch the mission unfold.
- Built with **authentic physics**, featuring:
  - Progressive level system
  - Scoring system
  - Lives counter
  - Scoreboard displaying current level, points, successful saves, and remaining attempts
- Gamified learning experience that helps users understand planetary defense science.
